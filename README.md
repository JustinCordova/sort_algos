# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This project is a **Sorting Algorithm Visualization Tool** built with Python and Pygame. It demonstrates various sorting algorithms by visualizing how they process and organize data. The tool provides an interactive, graphical representation of sorting processes, making it an educational resource for learning how different algorithms work.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Bogo Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Bucket Sort

- **Interactive Visualization**:
  - Dynamic display of sorting progress.
  - Highlighting of elements being compared or swapped.
  - Real-time updates for each sorting step.

- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Adjustable screen dimensions and bar sizes.
  - Randomized generation of data bars to sort.

- **Responsive Application**:
  - Handles user interactions and system events during runtime.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Pygame library

   Install Pygame using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
2. Run
   ```bash
